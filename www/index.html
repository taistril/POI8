			whose waters were 'beneficial to health'.  From then, visitors flocked to Harrogate to 'take the waters'.</p>
			<p>The first Pump Room was built in 1786 and its popularity grew and, in Victorian times, many formal buildings 
			were erected; New Victoria Baths (1871), the Royal Baths (1897) and many large hotels.</p>
			<p>You can still indulge in a Turkish Bath, massage, or other treatments there today, but nobody 'takes the waters' now, 
			for health and safety reasons. 
			You can still visit the Pump Room museum and smell the water that people drank.</p>
			<p>Today, Harrogate still has many grand hotels and hosts large events both inside in the Exhibition Centre and outside, 
			such as the Yorkshire Show and the Flower Show.</p>

			The sulphur and kissingen springs beneath the building are among the finest in England.  
			The major extension of 1936-9, designed by Leonard Clarke, replaced the Winter Gardens with the 
			Lounge Hall and Fountain Court.  
			The development of the Royal Baths occurred a few years before the building of the Royal Hall and 
			Roundhill Reservoir which together must represent an almost unparalleled example of Municipal Enterprise'.</p>

			The old Town Hall has been variously known as The Promenade Room, The Victoria Room and the Town Hall Theatre.

			and renamed The White Swan.  
			After 1848 the Swan, by then a hotel, was owned and enlarged by Isaac Thomas Shutt, architect of the Royal Pump Room.  
			In 1878 Dr Richard Veale converted it into Harrogate's first hydropathic establishment, complete with Turkish Baths, 
			the hotel then becoming known as the Harrogate Hydro.  
			Famous guests included Karl Marx in 1873 and missing novelist Agatha Christie, who was found here in 1926 
			after the biggest manhunt in British history.  
			Requisitioned in the Second World War for use by the Air Ministry, the hotel re-opened in 1952 as the Old Swan, 
			and was used as a venue for the 1977 film Agatha starring Dustin Hoffman and Vanessa Redgrave'.</p>

			1913 titled La Douche.  It was purchased by Sir Dhunjibhoy Bomanji for his principal home, The Willows, in Windsor.  
			It remained in Windsor until the 1950s when Lady Bomanji moved to her Harrogate residence, owned by the family 
			from the mid 1920s. Well known and a generous benefactor to Harrogate, Lady Bomanji was awarded the 
			Freedom of the Borough in 1984.  
			In all her good works she was ably supported by her daughter Mehroo, who continued the family tradition of
